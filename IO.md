## IO

_Defines input and output for the game._

Input (event signals): W, A, S, D, Click, LeftClick, RightClick, 1, 2, 3, 4, DOM inputs (which overlap)

Output (pixels on a screen): across-platform fullscreen WebGL canvas.

Input is a proxy for the DOM event system and Output is a proxy for `<canvas>`.
